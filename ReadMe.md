The project uses the famous Iris dataset to build and evaluate classification models. The dataset contains four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) to classify three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
Data Analysis Insights
Looking at the visualizations:

Feature Distributions (Image 8): There's clear separation between species. Setosa has notably shorter petals than the other species, making it easily distinguishable.
Box Plots (Image 6):

Setosa has the shortest sepal and petal lengths
Virginica has the longest sepals and petals
Setosa has the widest sepals but narrowest petals


Pairplot (Image 9): Shows excellent separation of setosa from the other species across all features. Versicolor and virginica overlap somewhat but can still be distinguished.
Feature Correlation (Image 7):

Strong positive correlation (0.96) between petal length and petal width
Strong positive correlations between sepal length and both petal measurements
Slight negative correlation between sepal width and other measurements


Feature Importance (Image 5):

Petal width is the most important feature (about 0.45)
Petal length is the second most important (about 0.40)
Sepal measurements have much lower importance



Model Performance
Three classification models were evaluated:

Random Forest (Image 2):

Perfect classification of setosa
Misclassified 1 versicolor as virginica
Misclassified 4 virginica as versicolor


Support Vector Machine (Image 3):

Perfect classification of setosa
Misclassified 1 versicolor as virginica
Misclassified 2 virginica as versicolor
Overall best performance with 42/45 correct classifications


K-Nearest Neighbors (Image 1):

Perfect classification of setosa
Perfect classification of versicolor
Misclassified 4 virginica as versicolor
Tied with SVM for accuracy


Decision Boundaries (Image 4):

After PCA, shows clear separation of the three species

Key Observations

The Iris setosa is the most distinct species and can be perfectly classified by all models.
Versicolor and virginica have some overlap, particularly for virginica samples that get misclassified as versicolor.
Petal measurements are much more important than sepal measurements for classification.
The Support Vector Machine model appears to be the best performer among the three, though all models achieve >90% accuracy.

This project demonstrates good machine learning practices including data exploration, visualization, model evaluation, and deployment. The code includes well-documented steps and generates comprehensive visualizations to understand the dataset and model performance.
